# How to start SnailyCADv4 with Screen

You can run snailycad under a `screen` session so you can safely close the terminal/ssh window without risking it closing out on you!

## Creating a `screen` session

First you need to create the screen by running the following command:

```
screen -S snailycad
```

:::tip
_You can change `snailycad` to whatever. It's just a name to identify the screen session_
:::

after you confirm, it will open the screen session. Here you can go to your snailycad instance folder and run:

```bash
pnpm run start
```

Afterwards do CTRL A + X (**Not CTRL C**) to exit the screen session.

## Re-open a `screen` session

If you want to reopen that session you can list all the screens using the following command:

```bash
screen -list
```

## Reconnect to a `screen` session

To reconnect to an existing screen like the one you created run the following command:

```bash
screen -r -D snailycad
```

:::tip
Make sure to `snailycad` to your screen name.
