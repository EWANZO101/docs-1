# Release 1.67.0

This release includes tons of improvements, bug fixes, and new features.

**Updated FiveM Integrations**

Since this update and [`fivem-integrations@0.5.0`], you are now able to do the following things:

- Authenticate with your SnailyCAD instance using User API Tokens: `/sn-auth`.
- See what user you're currently authenticated as: `/sn-whoami`.
- See your active unit's name & id: `/sn-active-unit`.
- Set the status of your active unit: `/sn-set-status` (if no statusCode is provided, a modal will open with all possible status codes.).
- Toggle the panic button state of your active unit: `/sn-panic-button`.

**New Audit Log Types**

There are a few new audit log types:

- `Signal100Toggled`
- `Call911Create`

**Images for registered vehicles and vehicle values**

Citizens can now add images to your registered vehicles. Admins are also able to upload previews for vehicle values.

**Improved Live Map Actions**

The live map actions have been improved. Some actions are now stacked in a dropdown menu.
This change was made to clear up to UI [for future updates](https://github.com/SnailyCAD/snaily-cadv4/issues/1752).

**Pagination fixes**

Several pages didn't yet have pagination. The latest release fixed this.

**Bug fixes**
