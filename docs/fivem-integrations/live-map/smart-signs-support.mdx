# London Studios SmartSigns Support

Since [`sna-live-map@0.1.0`](https://github.com/SnailyCAD/live-map/releases/latest) we have added support for London Studios SmartSigns.
This allows dispatchers to view all SmartSigns and allows dispatchers with the `Manage SmartSigns` permission to edit SmartSigns directly on the Dispatch Live Map.

## How to use

1. Purchase & Download the latest version of [`SmartSigns`](https://forum.cfx.re/t/smart-signs-customisable-traffic-signs-real-time-edits-configurable-paid-resource/2604493).
2. Install the resource as `SmartSigns` in your `resources` folder.
3. Download the latest release of [`sna-live-map`](https://github.com/SnailyCAD/live-map/releases/latest).
4. Done
