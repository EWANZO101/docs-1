# How to migrate from yarn to pnpm

Since version `1.70.0`, SnailyCAD uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) instead of [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
This is because pnpm is faster and uses less disk space.

## How to migrate

1. Pull the latest changes: `git pull origin main`
2. Install pnpm, follow our guides for either:
   - [Windows](/docs/guides/requirements/how-to-install-node-pnpm-npm)
   - [Linux](/docs/guides/requirements/how-to-install-node-pnpm-npm-linux)
3. Remove the `node_modules` folder.
4. Install the dependencies with `pnpm install`.
5. Get yourself up to update with the latest commands by reading the documentation.
