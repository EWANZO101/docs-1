# Release 1.78.1

This release includes a major bug fix and some other fixes.

**Incorrect behaviour unit merging**

When having `Units Inactivity` set to a value, it would not correctly read the units from the database,
since it would think the units weren't active for long enough.
This has been fixed in this release.

**API Build**

SnailyCAD API now requires a build before it can be started. This change should be automatic.
This should lower memory usage since it doesn't have to build/transpile the API on the fly.
