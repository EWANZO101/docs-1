# London Studios SmartSigns Support

Since [`sna-live-map@0.1.0`](https://github.com/SnailyCAD/live-map/releases/latest) we have added support for London Studios SmartSigns.
This allows dispatchers to view all SmartSigns and allows dispatchers with the `Manage SmartSigns` permission to edit SmartSigns directly on the Dispatch Live Map.

## How to use

:::warning Not currently supported
The latest version of SmartSigns has a bug in the code. It currently will not place the SmartSigns on the correct X-axis.
A bug report has been opened and we are awaiting a fix.

Once London Studios has pushed a fix for this issue, you will be able to immediately use this feature.

**Manually fixing this issue**

If you are comfortable with editing the code yourself, you can manually update the code to fix this issue:

1. Open the `sv_smartsigns.lua` file and go to line `325`.
2. Replace `["x"] = v.coords.z,` with `["x"] = v.coords.x,`
3. Save the file and start/restart the resource.
